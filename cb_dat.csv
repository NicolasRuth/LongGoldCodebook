mps;Musical Preference Assessment via soundclips;english;;test;This is a listening test that captures musical preferences for each of the five factor of the MUSIC model (Rentfrow, Goldberg, & Levitin, 2011). A 15s excerpt from each of 25 unpublished tracks (5 for each factor) is rated on a 5-point rating scale that asks for liking of the track.;25;no;;5-point rating scale;;Rentfrow, P. J., Goldberg, L.

mpt;Mistuning Perception Test;english;;test;The MTP measures the ability to recognize if the pitch of the singing voice sounds right or wrong in relation to the background music. Each music excerpt is played twice and in one of the examples the pitch level of the singing voice has been moved up or down. The task is to identify this wrong-sounding version.;22;flexible length;;2-alternative forced choice;https://shiny.gold-msi.org/longgold_demo/?test=MPT;Larrouy-Maestri, P., Harrison, P.

pit;Pitch Imagery Arrows Test;english;;test;The ability to silently hear music in the mind has been argued to be fundamental to musicality. Objective measurements of this subjective imagery experience are needed if this link between imagery ability and musicality is to be investigated. However, previous tests of musical imagery either rely on self-report, rely on melodic memory, or do not cater in range of abilities. The Pitch Imagery Arrow Task (PIAT) was designed to address these shortcomings.;25;no;;binary true/false judgements ;https://shiny.gold-msi.org/longgold_demo/?test=PIT;Gelding, R., Harrison, P., Silas, S., Johnson, B., Thompson, W., & Muellensiefen, D.

bds;Backward Digit Span Working Memory Test;english;;test;BDS tasks represent a classic measure of WM (Case & Globerson, 1974), requiring participants to remember a sequence of digits, mentally reverse the sequence, and enter the reversed sequence. Because this BDS task required responding by clicking the numbers on a keypad, it had a particular visuospatial quality to it compared to other BDS tasks.;12;no;;;https://shiny.gold-msi.org/longgold_demo/?test=BDS;;;;yes;;;;;;;1.21
